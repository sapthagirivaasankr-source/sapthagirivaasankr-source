## About me
I'm a Backend Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience building reliable, maintainable, and scalable backend systems. I focus on Java and Spring Boot to design and implement REST APIs, backend services, and data-processing pipelines. I naturally think in terms of data flow, validations, and component interactions — and I enjoy breaking complex requirements into simple, testable services.

I care about:
- Production-readiness: error handling, observability, and resilience
- Clean code and maintainability
- Performance and correctness under load
- Pragmatic design decisions that enable long-term stability

## Highlights
- 2+ years building backend services, REST APIs, and batch/data-processing logic
- Strong Java & Spring Boot experience
- Experience with relational and NoSQL databases, monitoring, and CI/CD
- Comfortable in Agile teams — clear communication and collaboration

## Approach & Best Practices
- Design services around clear responsibilities and data ownership
- Write unit and integration tests to catch regressions early
- Use logging, metrics, and traces for production observability
- Automate builds and deployments with CI/CD pipelines
- Prioritize backward-compatible changes and gradual rollouts

---

## Currently learning
- Advanced Spring features and reactive programming
- System design patterns for high-throughput services
- Observability and production debugging techniques
